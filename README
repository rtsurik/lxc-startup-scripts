REQUIREMENTS

lxc
bridge-utils
parprouted 
	I use it to easily bridge veth devices with wlan,
	though it would be possible to use ebtables or something,
	and for a wired network you can do this w/ bridge-utils

TODO

This is just a quick hack to create and start up multiple LXC containers,
does exactly what I need from it and is not likely to be developed further.
